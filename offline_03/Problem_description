The initial experiment is done with 15 types of common vegetables that are found throughout the world. The vegetables that are chosen for the experimentation are- bean, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, brinjal, broccoli, 
cabbage, capsicum, carrot, cauliflower, cucumber, papaya, potato, pumpkin, radish and tomato. A total of 21000 images from 15 classes are used where each class contains 1400 images of size 224Ã—224 and in *.jpg format. 

This dataset contains three folders:
train (15000 images)
test (3000 images)
validation (3000 images)
each of the above folders contains 15 subfolders for different vegetables wherein the images for respective vegetables are present.
For our coding purpose, we will only consider train and test folders. I make a notebook for you where I have already loader train and test data with resizing (32x32) and gray color. You can use that code.

Instead of downloading and upload dataset in google drive, you can directly write code on kaggle platform.

Your task:
i. All algorithm will implemented with only numpy and basic python.
ii. Design KNN class which has init(k) constructor and train(X_train,Y_train,X_test) function. init function sets the hyperparameter k and train function takes train and test data, finds the output of the test data  only using numpy. 
iii. Design Logistics Regression class which has init(epochs, lr) constructor, train(X,y), and predict(X) function. init function sets the hyperparameter epochs and learning rate. train function is used to training the model
(find the perfect weight and bias). predict function is used to find the output of the test data.
iv. Design Kmeans class which has init(k) constructor and train(X) function. init function sets the hyperparameter k and train function takes X and make k cluster of them.
